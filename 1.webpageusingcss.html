<h1 style="color:black;text-align: center;"><u><em>CONSTITUTION OF INDIA</em></u></h1>
<h1>Article 18</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:Algerian;">Shri Biswanath Das (Orissa: General): Mr. Vice-President, Sir, I stand to oppose article 277 as unnecessary in this Constitution. Sir, the emergency powers incorporated in this Constitution are more or less adapted on the lines of Section 93 of the Government of India Act, 1935.. These are different questions and have to be considered from a different point of view. As I have stated on many occasions, I repeat that we are contemplating party Government in a system of democracy.</p>

<h1>Article 19</h1>
<p style="color: purple;text-align:left;font-size:20px;font-family:Algerian;">Sir, we come to the question of domestic violence and any acts of violence which according to the- President are considered imminent and dangerous. These are different questions and have to be considered from a different point of view. As I have stated on many occasions, I repeat that we are contemplating party Government in a system of democracy.1 do,not see any reason why the Drafting Committee should have taken this course without any authority1 do,not see any reason why the Drafting Committee should have taken this course without any authority</p>
